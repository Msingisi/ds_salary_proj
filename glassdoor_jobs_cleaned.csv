It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
We’re looking for a Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Kojo’s intelligent procurement platform. This highly impactful role will be a part of our small DS function and build machine learning models, analyze and process various types of data for our customer-facing product to supercharge our customers’ materials procurement decisions.
About the Role
The ideal person in this role is an experienced full-stack data scientist or ML engineer who can train rich real-world data into production models that enhance key decisions for our customers during the materials procurement process.
In addition, you have an opportunity to collaborate with the DS lead and engineering team on our ML platform, and with the product and leadership team on the Kojo intelligence strategy.
This role will include:
Diving into our dataset and design, implement, and scale customer-facing data-driven ML models and algorithms
Critically reviewing and interpreting data findings to ensure alignment with business goals
Collaborating with engineering, product, and business teams to integrate data insights into actionable strategies
Providing uniquely valuable insights to our customers with dashboard, reports, and recommendations
Working on initiatives to ensure the stability, performance and reliability of our data infrastructure
About You
An impactful and collaborative Data Scientist with experience building ML/AI models for customer-facing products will thrive in this role! If you’re excited about applying your skills to weave insights, recommendations, and AI into the Kojo platform, apply with us!
What you’ve accomplished:
3+ years of experience in an ML-focused data role
Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them
Innovation: You look for the truth behind problems and for “10x” solutions
Growth: You are excited by problems because they’re opportunities for improvement
The salary range for this role is between $100,000 and $160,000 for candidates located in the US or Canada, commensurate with experience and location. The role is remote with no travel required.
Working at Kojo
Salary: Your salary will be dependent upon many factors, including your experience level, skillset, market dynamics and balancing internal equity relative to other Kojo employees. The compensation and benefits information that we provide is based on Kojo’s good-faith estimate as of the date of the job posting and may be modified in the future.
Benefits: This position is also eligible for a new hire equity grant and all US-based full time employees are eligible for our full suite of perks and benefits. For more information about our perks and benefits, check out https://www.usekojo.com/careers.
Location: Kojo’s team members work from home 100% of the time across North and South America. If applicable, we’ll identify the travel and/or location-specific requirements of a position in the text above. Otherwise, team members can expect to work business hours congruent with their local time zone and remotely.

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
We’re looking for a Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Kojo’s intelligent procurement platform. This highly impactful role will be a part of our small DS function and build machine learning models, analyze and process various types of data for our customer-facing product to supercharge our customers’ materials procurement decisions.

Diving into our dataset and design, implement, and scale customer-facing data-driven ML models and algorithms
Critically reviewing and interpreting data findings to ensure alignment with business goals
Collaborating with engineering, product, and business teams to integrate data insights into actionable strategies
Providing uniquely valuable insights to our customers with dashboard, reports, and recommendations
Working on initiatives to ensure the stability, performance and reliability of our data infrastructure
About You
An impactful and collaborative Data Scientist with experience building ML/AI models for customer-facing products will thrive in this role! If you’re excited about applying your skills to weave insights, recommendations, and AI into the Kojo platform, apply with us!
What you’ve accomplished:
3+ years of experience in an ML-focused data role
Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them
Innovation: You look for the truth behind problems and for “10x” solutions
Growth: You are excited by problems because they’re opportunities for improvement
The salary range for this role is between $100,000 and $160,000 for candidates located in the US or Canada, commensurate with experience and location. The role is remote with no travel required.
Working at Kojo

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
We’re looking for a Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Kojo’s intelligent procurement platform. This highly impactful role will be a part of our small DS function and build machine learning models, analyze and process various types of data for our customer-facing product to supercharge our customers’ materials procurement decisions.

This role will include:
Diving into our dataset and design, implement, and scale customer-facing data-driven ML models and algorithms
Critically reviewing and interpreting data findings to ensure alignment with business goals
Collaborating with engineering, product, and business teams to integrate data insights into actionable strategies
Providing uniquely valuable insights to our customers with dashboard, reports, and recommendations
Working on initiatives to ensure the stability, performance and reliability of our data infrastructure
About You
An impactful and collaborative Data Scientist with experience building ML/AI models for customer-facing products will thrive in this role! If you’re excited about applying your skills to weave insights, recommendations, and AI into the Kojo platform, apply with us!
What you’ve accomplished:
3+ years of experience in an ML-focused data role
Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them
Innovation: You look for the truth behind problems and for “10x” solutions
Growth: You are excited by problems because they’re opportunities for improvement

It's time to build.

We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
We’re looking for a Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Kojo’s intelligent procurement platform. This highly impactful role will be a part of our small DS function and build machine learning models, analyze and process various types of data for our customer-facing product to supercharge our customers’ materials procurement decisions.

3+ years of experience in an ML-focused data role
Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them

We believe that life is better when you’re with your friends, and our mission is to fill everyone’s life with rich and meaningful friendships. We do this by creating the easiest way to hear your friends’ voices throughout the day, to meet their friends, and to talk about anything. As the world goes increasingly remote, we think being with friends is more important than ever.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on building a product that people love. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to talk.

The Role
As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings. In this role, you will report to our Head of Growth. We are a remote-first company, but have a headquarters office in San Francisco.

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that are used by millions of people.

Who you are
You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.
You bring deep experience in product analytics and experiment design. You likely bring 4+ years of experience as a product data scientist or product analyst and have deep experience working on consumer products. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis.
You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.
You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.
You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.
You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.
You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

What you will do
You’ll help the team untangle key product questions with the team. There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in product launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of new features on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.
You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.
You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard.
You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle.

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
We’re looking for a Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Kojo’s intelligent procurement platform. This highly impactful role will be a part of our small DS function and build machine learning models, analyze and process various types of data for our customer-facing product to supercharge our customers’ materials procurement decisions.

3+ years of experience in an ML-focused data role
Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them
Innovation: You look for the truth behind problems and for “10x” solutions
Growth: You are excited by problems because they’re opportunities for improvement

We believe that life is better when you’re with your friends, and our mission is to fill everyone’s life with rich and meaningful friendships. We do this by creating the easiest way to hear your friends’ voices throughout the day, to meet their friends, and to talk about anything. As the world goes increasingly remote, we think being with friends is more important than ever.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on building a product that people love. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to talk.

The Role
As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings. In this role, you will report to our Head of Growth. We are a remote-first company, but have a headquarters office in San Francisco.

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that are used by millions of people.

Who you are
You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.
You bring deep experience in product analytics and experiment design. You likely bring 4+ years of experience as a product data scientist or product analyst and have deep experience working on consumer products. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis.
You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.
You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.
You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.
You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.
You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

What you will do
You’ll help the team untangle key product questions with the team. There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in product launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of new features on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.
You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.
You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard.
You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it’s leading our work on a new platform or single-handedly figuring out how to scale concurrent audio streams to reach millions of users, we’ll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.
You’ll create something meaningful. Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across

As an early team member at Clubhouse you will be a critical voice and have significant influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and ensure this is the single best work experience of your life.

A little about E Source

Utilities across the US and Canada face the same fundamental, day-to-day challenges: to ensure reliable service for every customer while maintaining and modernizing aging distribution networks and meeting regulatory requirements—all while keeping rates affordable. At the same time, climate change has created a common, universal call to action: to reduce our carbon impact, improve our environment, and ensure the prosperity of future generations.

At E Source, we’re dedicated to helping every utility become a Sustainable Utility. That means doing the hard work it takes to achieve goals that often seem at odds with one another:

Environmental responsibility. Decarbonizing operations, reducing emissions, eliminating water leaks, and finding efficiencies.
Reliability. Providing safe, continuous, and consistent service in the face of increasing volatility caused by climate change, including extreme weather, drought, and fire.
Equity. Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses that are often disproportionately impacted by societal events.
Financial stability. Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities.

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet. With a commitment to practical innovation, we use more than three decades of utility-focused experience and our unique solution set to help our clients become a Sustainable Utility.

Benefits

We offer excellent insurance packages, including medical, dental, and vision plans; company-paid life insurance; company-paid long- and short-term disability insurance; and medical and dependent-care flexible spending plans.
We provide a flexible time off (FTO) program; E Source employees can take as many paid days off per year as they need, with manager approval, while fulfilling their work obligations and ensuring proper coverage of their responsibilities.
We offer flexible schedules, flexible work locations, and a paid parental leave benefit.
We provide a 401(k)/RRSP with a 3% employer match.

The budgeted salary for this position is $90,000–$140,000 USD (includes base salary + annual bonus). Actual pay will be adjusted based on experience.

This role will be 100% remote.

Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the US. We’re unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment visas at this time.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
We’re looking for a Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Kojo’s intelligent procurement platform. This highly impactful role will be a part of our small DS function and build machine learning models, analyze and process various types of data for our customer-facing product to supercharge our customers’ materials procurement decisions.

Working on initiatives to ensure the stability, performance and reliability of our data infrastructure
About You
An impactful and collaborative Data Scientist with experience building ML/AI models for customer-facing products will thrive in this role! If you’re excited about applying your skills to weave insights, recommendations, and AI into the Kojo platform, apply with us!

3+ years of experience in an ML-focused data role
Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them
Innovation: You look for the truth behind problems and for “10x” solutions
Growth: You are excited by problems because they’re opportunities for improvement

We believe that life is better when you’re with your friends, and our mission is to fill everyone’s life with rich and meaningful friendships. We do this by creating the easiest way to hear your friends’ voices throughout the day, to meet their friends, and to talk about anything. As the world goes increasingly remote, we think being with friends is more important than ever.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on building a product that people love. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to talk.

The Role
As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings. In this role, you will report to our Head of Growth. We are a remote-first company, but have a headquarters office in San Francisco.

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that are used by millions of people.

Who you are
You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.
You bring deep experience in product analytics and experiment design. You likely bring 4+ years of experience as a product data scientist or product analyst and have deep experience working on consumer products. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis.
You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.
You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.
You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.
You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.
You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

What you will do
You’ll help the team untangle key product questions with the team. There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in product launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of new features on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.
You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.
You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard.
You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it’s leading our work on a new platform or single-handedly figuring out how to scale concurrent audio streams to reach millions of users, we’ll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.
You’ll create something meaningful. Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across

As an early team member at Clubhouse you will be a critical voice and have significant influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and ensure this is the single best work experience of your life.

A little about E Source

Utilities across the US and Canada face the same fundamental, day-to-day challenges: to ensure reliable service for every customer while maintaining and modernizing aging distribution networks and meeting regulatory requirements—all while keeping rates affordable. At the same time, climate change has created a common, universal call to action: to reduce our carbon impact, improve our environment, and ensure the prosperity of future generations.

At E Source, we’re dedicated to helping every utility become a Sustainable Utility. That means doing the hard work it takes to achieve goals that often seem at odds with one another:

Environmental responsibility. Decarbonizing operations, reducing emissions, eliminating water leaks, and finding efficiencies.
Reliability. Providing safe, continuous, and consistent service in the face of increasing volatility caused by climate change, including extreme weather, drought, and fire.
Equity. Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses that are often disproportionately impacted by societal events.
Financial stability. Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities.

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet. With a commitment to practical innovation, we use more than three decades of utility-focused experience and our unique solution set to help our clients become a Sustainable Utility.

We provide a flexible time off (FTO) program; E Source employees can take as many paid days off per year as they need, with manager approval, while fulfilling their work obligations and ensuring proper coverage of their responsibilities.
We offer flexible schedules, flexible work locations, and a paid parental leave benefit.
We provide a 401(k)/RRSP with a 3% employer match.

The budgeted salary for this position is $90,000–$140,000 USD (includes base salary + annual bonus). Actual pay will be adjusted based on experience.

This role will be 100% remote.

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
We’re looking for a Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Kojo’s intelligent procurement platform. This highly impactful role will be a part of our small DS function and build machine learning models, analyze and process various types of data for our customer-facing product to supercharge our customers’ materials procurement decisions.

3+ years of experience in an ML-focused data role
Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them
Innovation: You look for the truth behind problems and for “10x” solutions
Growth: You are excited by problems because they’re opportunities for improvement

We believe that life is better when you’re with your friends, and our mission is to fill everyone’s life with rich and meaningful friendships. We do this by creating the easiest way to hear your friends’ voices throughout the day, to meet their friends, and to talk about anything. As the world goes increasingly remote, we think being with friends is more important than ever.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on building a product that people love. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to talk.

The Role
As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings. In this role, you will report to our Head of Growth. We are a remote-first company, but have a headquarters office in San Francisco.

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that are used by millions of people.

Who you are
You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.
You bring deep experience in product analytics and experiment design. You likely bring 4+ years of experience as a product data scientist or product analyst and have deep experience working on consumer products. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis.
You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.
You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.
You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.
You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.
You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

What you will do
You’ll help the team untangle key product questions with the team. There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in product launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of new features on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.
You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.
You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard.
You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it’s leading our work on a new platform or single-handedly figuring out how to scale concurrent audio streams to reach millions of users, we’ll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.
You’ll create something meaningful. Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across

It may vary based on the applicant’s level of experience, education, specialized knowledge, skills, and the market rate for similar positions. The salary range is subject to change and may be modified in the future.

As an early team member at Clubhouse you will be a critical voice and have significant influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and ensure this is the single best work experience of your life.

A little about E Source

Utilities across the US and Canada face the same fundamental, day-to-day challenges: to ensure reliable service for every customer while maintaining and modernizing aging distribution networks and meeting regulatory requirements—all while keeping rates affordable. At the same time, climate change has created a common, universal call to action: to reduce our carbon impact, improve our environment, and ensure the prosperity of future generations.

At E Source, we’re dedicated to helping every utility become a Sustainable Utility. That means doing the hard work it takes to achieve goals that often seem at odds with one another:

Environmental responsibility. Decarbonizing operations, reducing emissions, eliminating water leaks, and finding efficiencies.
Reliability. Providing safe, continuous, and consistent service in the face of increasing volatility caused by climate change, including extreme weather, drought, and fire.
Equity. Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses that are often disproportionately impacted by societal events.
Financial stability. Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities.

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet. With a commitment to practical innovation, we use more than three decades of utility-focused experience and our unique solution set to help our clients become a Sustainable Utility.

Benefits

We offer excellent insurance packages, including medical, dental, and vision plans; company-paid life insurance; company-paid long- and short-term disability insurance; and medical and dependent-care flexible spending plans.
We provide a flexible time off (FTO) program; E Source employees can take as many paid days off per year as they need, with manager approval, while fulfilling their work obligations and ensuring proper coverage of their responsibilities.
We offer flexible schedules, flexible work locations, and a paid parental leave benefit.
We provide a 401(k)/RRSP with a 3% employer match.

The budgeted salary for this position is $90,000–$140,000 USD (includes base salary + annual bonus). Actual pay will be adjusted based on experience.

This role will be 100% remote.

Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the US. We’re unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment visas at this time.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.

It's time to build.

We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.
Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices.

Experience with our tech stack: Python, SQL, and BI Tooling required; + Azure, AWS, GCP, and Docker preferred
Track record of executing quickly and iterating effectively on projects
Empathy when working with internal cross-functional stakeholders and on client-facing work
A history of raising the quality of real-world business and usage data to the level required to produce reliable insights.
Keen ability to translate nontechnical requests into precise and reliable terms
An understanding of complex disparate data sources and how to unify them
What you care about:
Customer Obsession: You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them

We believe that life is better when you’re with your friends, and our mission is to fill everyone’s life with rich and meaningful friendships. We do this by creating the easiest way to hear your friends’ voices throughout the day, to meet their friends, and to talk about anything. As the world goes increasingly remote, we think being with friends is more important than ever.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on building a product that people love. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. If this sounds interesting to you, we’d love to talk.

The Role
As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings. In this role, you will report to our Head of Growth. We are a remote-first company, but have a headquarters office in San Francisco.

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that are used by millions of people.

Who you are
You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.
You bring deep experience in product analytics and experiment design. You likely bring 4+ years of experience as a product data scientist or product analyst and have deep experience working on consumer products. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis.
You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.
You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.
You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.
You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.
You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

What you will do
You’ll help the team untangle key product questions with the team. There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in product launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of new features on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.
You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.
You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard.
You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle. Whether it’s leading our work on a new platform or single-handedly figuring out how to scale concurrent audio streams to reach millions of users, we’ll make sure you are always pushing yourself to new levels.
You’ll create something meaningful. Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across

About The Role:
This is an opportunity to join a small team and make a substantial impact at Bowery. We’re looking for someone that can learn, adapt and roll with a fast-paced, ever-changing environment and who isn’t afraid of uncertainty.

Data analysis at Bowery means building data pipelines, crafting data visualizations, and helping a wide range of teams interpret reams of data generated by “the Techiest Farm in the World.” The data function at Bowery is central to the vision of the company as well as its day-to-day operation. You’ll be part of the Data & AI team which is responsible for everything from collecting data, to reporting facts, investigative analysis, building machine learning, and computer vision models.

This role is based out of our NYC HQ. We follow a hybrid working model.
What You'll Do:
Develop SQL to transform the raw data produced by the farm into a comprehensive data warehouse as the authoritative source for all facts about the business.

You are comfortable working in a highly technical team: contributing through version control, peer-reviewing code, and managing processes in production.
You are comfortable being the technical resource for non-technical teams: translating business needs to technical requirements, communicating quantitative observations to make the teams around us more effective and well-informed.
You’ve got a natural attention to detail and drive for order that yields accuracy and reliability in the data you work with.
You can own the critical trust-based relationship with our internal stakeholders.
You have experience in and a passion for visualizing data to tell clear stories and support decision-making.
You have experience with data science languages like R or python, and enjoy learning more.
You’re confident in taking ownership of projects from start to finish and enjoy the process of turning nebulous ideas into reality.
You believe that teams succeed and fail together and take responsibility for ensuring the success and safety of your teammates.

Bowery is a place where everyone is welcome, included, and empowered to reach their full potential.
We live our shared values every day in both big and small ways: opt in, think wildly different, break barriers together & be kind to the core
We are a mission-driven team of unconventional thinkers, problem-solvers, optimists, and activators
We share a passion for giving back more to the planet than we take, growing deliciously abundant food without abundant harm

The ability to simplify complex analyses into understandable concepts that are applicable to management and operations staff is highly desired.

What will make you a good fit

Candidates should have a four-year college degree with a master’s or PhD preferred in a technical field such as statistics, economics, mathematics, or electrical engineering. Strong communication and presentation skills are required.

Our ideal candidates will have significant experience using R or Python (with a preference for fluency in both) in the context of data science proof of concept and ongoing operational support projects, in AWS and Azure workspaces. Databricks experience is a plus. You should have a strong understanding of several different families of statistical and machine learning models, for example:
Generalized linear models
Time series approaches
Penalized regression models
Tree-based ensemble models
Neural network models
Natural language processing

The ideal candidate will have professional experience in the utility sector and familiarity with customer and distribution grid data models, but this is not required.

A little about E Source

Utilities across the US and Canada face the same fundamental, day-to-day challenges: to ensure reliable service for every customer while maintaining and modernizing aging distribution networks and meeting regulatory requirements—all while keeping rates affordable. At the same time, climate change has created a common, universal call to action: to reduce our carbon impact, improve our environment, and ensure the prosperity of future generations.

At E Source, we’re dedicated to helping every utility become a Sustainable Utility. That means doing the hard work it takes to achieve goals that often seem at odds with one another:

Environmental responsibility. Decarbonizing operations, reducing emissions, eliminating water leaks, and finding efficiencies.
Reliability. Providing safe, continuous, and consistent service in the face of increasing volatility caused by climate change, including extreme weather, drought, and fire.
Equity. Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses that are often disproportionately impacted by societal events.
Financial stability. Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities.

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet. With a commitment to practical innovation, we use more than three decades of utility-focused experience and our unique solution set to help our clients become a Sustainable Utility.

Benefits

We offer excellent insurance packages, including medical, dental, and vision plans; company-paid life insurance; company-paid long- and short-term disability insurance; and medical and dependent-care flexible spending plans.
We provide a flexible time off (FTO) program; E Source employees can take as many paid days off per year as they need, with manager approval, while fulfilling their work obligations and ensuring proper coverage of their responsibilities.
We offer flexible schedules, flexible work locations, and a paid parental leave benefit.
We provide a 401(k)/RRSP with a 3% employer match.

The budgeted salary for this position is $90,000–$140,000 USD (includes base salary + annual bonus). Actual pay will be adjusted based on experience.

This role will be 100% remote.

Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in the US. We’re unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment visas at this time.

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.
