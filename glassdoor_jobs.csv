Health, Dental and Vision benefits are excellent. Long term disability is not as good as it used to be there is no longer a pension plan, Some other benefits have taken a hit in recent years, but probably no different than other similar companies (hence I docked a star for these changes). Work from home 2-3 days a week, which is nice and there is a gym at the office, so that's a benefit.

Senior Data Scientist,-1,"About Metaplane
Metaplane helps companies trust their data.
Before Metaplane, data teams were often the last to find out about data quality issues. Silent data bugs can disrupt ETL systems, warehouses, and downstream BI tools, causing incorrect decisions to be made and a loss of trust in the data that is hard to gain back. Imagine software engineering teams lacking a tool like Datadog and only finding out about issues when users complain or simply stop using your application — that is the state of data teams today.
We’re building a platform for high performing data teams (like Bose, Sotheby’s, Ramp, Klaviyo, Sigma, and many more) so they can continuously monitor their data pipelines and know when things break, what went wrong, and how to fix it — all before downstream consumers message them asking “is this dashboard broken?”

Health, Dental and Vision benefits are excellent. Long term disability is not as good as it used to be there is no longer a pension plan, Some other benefits have taken a hit in recent years, but probably no different than other similar companies (hence I docked a star for these changes). Work from home 2-3 days a week, which is nice and there is a gym at the office, so that's a benefit.

Senior Data Scientist,-1,"About Metaplane
Metaplane helps companies trust their data.
Before Metaplane, data teams were often the last to find out about data quality issues. Silent data bugs can disrupt ETL systems, warehouses, and downstream BI tools, causing incorrect decisions to be made and a loss of trust in the data that is hard to gain back. Imagine software engineering teams lacking a tool like Datadog and only finding out about issues when users complain or simply stop using your application — that is the state of data teams today.
We’re building a platform for high performing data teams (like Bose, Sotheby’s, Ramp, Klaviyo, Sigma, and many more) so they can continuously monitor their data pipelines and know when things break, what went wrong, and how to fix it — all before downstream consumers message them asking “is this dashboard broken?”

- The 401K match is not 100% yours, you'll have to wait 6 years to get 100% of their match. Most big companies do not have that. - Paternity leave is only 2 weeks, and that isn't enough time. It's little time for a father to bond with their child and care for their partner, and in turn, implies that it’s the mother who is to be the primary caregiver. Both parents play a role when welcoming a new born and equalizing the roles of men and women both in the workplace and at home is critical. Also, many companies, including my partner's, are giving 12-16 weeks maternity leave for both parents with flexible options on how to use it. - Paid time off and Health Insurance are good.",4.0,WebstaurantStore,"Lititz, PA",1001 to 5000 Employees,2004,Company - Private,Other Retail Stores,Retail & Wholesale,$500 million to $1 billion (USD)

Employer summary
TriNet is a company committed to offering a benefits package that provides security and well-being to its colleagues and their eligible dependents, including domestic partners.
INSURANCE COVERAGE CHOICES
Coverage choices provide flexibility in the type and cost of colleague benefits. TriNet’s medical, dental and vision insurance programs offer a wide range of benefit options. Depending on the plan you select, TriNet may cover up to 90% of the cost of colleague benefits and up to 75% of the cost toward coverage for dependents. Plan choices include PPO, HDHP and HMO plans from leading medical, dental and vision insurance providers.
SHORT/LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND LIFE AND AD&D COVERAGE
TriNet pays 100% of the cost for short- and longterm disability coverage for full- time colleagues. TriNet also provides company-paid Basic Life and AD&D coverage in the amount of two times your annual base benefits rate (defined as base salary, commission and bonus), with minimum coverage of $100,000 and maximum coverage of $1 million.
401(K) SAVINGS PLAN

PayPal wants our employees to feel secure in their benefits, and we support your mental, physical, and emotional balance. Best of all, you are eligible for coverage on your date of hire.

Health and Welfare
Our fulltime U.S.-based employees are eligible for a variety of medical, dental, and vision plans, as well as Short- and Long-Term Disability, Life Insurance, and Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D).

Best thing is the unlimited PTO, work from home flexibility, and company bonuses. Worst thing is the health insurance, just because costs keep going up each year. While LH covers a significant portion of health insurance costs, it's still a painful bump if utilizing family plans. I'm assuming the health insurance premium increases are an across company thing, rather than an isolated element LH can control.

In 1976, there were only 250 computers in India. It was then that Shiv Nadar, the founder of HCL, led a team of eight young people who passionately believed in the power of information technology. From that vision, grew a global enterprise that redefined the Indian IT industry.
Today, HCLTech (which spun off as a separate unit in 1991) is one of the leading IT service providers worldwide. But while we may be a globally recognized leader in the tech and IT industry, we’ve never forgotten the start-up mindset that got us here.
We’ve always approached our work with an idea-first attitude because every one of our accomplishments—no matter how big or small—can be traced back to an idea’s single spark.
It’s that spark—that inner drive—that sets our people apart from our competitors. It enables us not just to pull off game-changing feat after game-changing feat but to better our world in the process.
At HCLTech, you’ll supercharge your potential.
You’ll find your career.
And you’ll find your spark.
All at a place that knows that helping its customers stay on top starts by putting its people first.
We offer:
career opportunities on your terms
enriching job experiences
an employment that you can trust in
a diverse, international culture that values your whole self
We have been recognized as a Global Top Employer by the Top Employers Institute for the second time in a row for outstanding HR policies and best practices worldwide. We have also been certified as a Top Employer in 26 countries across three regions, Asia Pacific, Europe & Africa and North America.
These accolades re-affirm our commitment to our people by helping them maximize their potential and building an inclusive and progressive workplace that help our employees find their spark. To learn how we can supercharge progress for you,click here

Health, Dental and Vision benefits are excellent. Long term disability is not as good as it used to be there is no longer a pension plan, Some other benefits have taken a hit in recent years, but probably no different than other similar companies (hence I docked a star for these changes). Work from home 2-3 days a week, which is nice and there is a gym at the office, so that's a benefit.

Senior Data Scientist,-1,"About Metaplane
Metaplane helps companies trust their data.
Before Metaplane, data teams were often the last to find out about data quality issues. Silent data bugs can disrupt ETL systems, warehouses, and downstream BI tools, causing incorrect decisions to be made and a loss of trust in the data that is hard to gain back. Imagine software engineering teams lacking a tool like Datadog and only finding out about issues when users complain or simply stop using your application — that is the state of data teams today.
We’re building a platform for high performing data teams (like Bose, Sotheby’s, Ramp, Klaviyo, Sigma, and many more) so they can continuously monitor their data pipelines and know when things break, what went wrong, and how to fix it — all before downstream consumers message them asking “is this dashboard broken?”

- The 401K match is not 100% yours, you'll have to wait 6 years to get 100% of their match. Most big companies do not have that. - Paternity leave is only 2 weeks, and that isn't enough time. It's little time for a father to bond with their child and care for their partner, and in turn, implies that it’s the mother who is to be the primary caregiver. Both parents play a role when welcoming a new born and equalizing the roles of men and women both in the workplace and at home is critical. Also, many companies, including my partner's, are giving 12-16 weeks maternity leave for both parents with flexible options on how to use it. - Paid time off and Health Insurance are good.",4.0,WebstaurantStore,"Lititz, PA",1001 to 5000 Employees,2004,Company - Private,Other Retail Stores,Retail & Wholesale,$500 million to $1 billion (USD)

Depending on the plan you select, TriNet may cover up to 90% of the cost of colleague benefits and up to 75% of the cost toward coverage for dependents.

SHORT/LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND LIFE AND AD&D COVERAGE
TriNet pays 100% of the cost for short- and longterm disability coverage for full- time colleagues.

Best thing is the unlimited PTO, work from home flexibility, and company bonuses. Worst thing is the health insurance, just because costs keep going up each year. While LH covers a significant portion of health insurance costs, it's still a painful bump if utilizing family plans. I'm assuming the health insurance premium increases are an across company thing, rather than an isolated element LH can control.

Today, HCLTech (which spun off as a separate unit in 1991) is one of the leading IT service providers worldwide. But while we may be a globally recognized leader in the tech and IT industry, we’ve never forgotten the start-up mindset that got us here.
We’ve always approached our work with an idea-first attitude because every one of our accomplishments—no matter how big or small—can be traced back to an idea’s single spark.
It’s that spark—that inner drive—that sets our people apart from our competitors. It enables us not just to pull off game-changing feat after game-changing feat but to better our world in the process.
At HCLTech, you’ll supercharge your potential.
You’ll find your career.
And you’ll find your spark.
All at a place that knows that helping its customers stay on top starts by putting its people first.
We offer:
career opportunities on your terms
enriching job experiences
an employment that you can trust in
a diverse, international culture that values your whole self
We have been recognized as a Global Top Employer by the Top Employers Institute for the second time in a row for outstanding HR policies and best practices worldwide. We have also been certified as a Top Employer in 26 countries across three regions, Asia Pacific, Europe & Africa and North America.

Find Your Path
Make an Impact
We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

Make an Impact
We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

The health benefits at MIT are fantastic, however the Disability services at MIT are not. When I approached Disability Services about accommodations with a doctor’s note and they were insensitive, inelegant and unprofessional in their dealings with me. They did not offer any support on bringing my accommodation requests to fruition and clearly indicated they did not think my requests for *a chronic and underlying condition* were not reasonable. They did not offer any advice on how to make the accommodations reasonable. I was shocked by their treatment of me until I realized their primary function was not to help the employees, but to protect MIT.",4.4,MIT,"Cambridge, MA",10000+ Employees,1861,College / University,Colleges & Universities,Education,$1 to $5 billion (USD)

Health, Dental and Vision benefits are excellent. Long term disability is not as good as it used to be there is no longer a pension plan, Some other benefits have taken a hit in recent years, but probably no different than other similar companies (hence I docked a star for these changes). Work from home 2-3 days a week, which is nice and there is a gym at the office, so that's a benefit.

Senior Data Scientist,-1,"About Metaplane
Metaplane helps companies trust their data.
Before Metaplane, data teams were often the last to find out about data quality issues. Silent data bugs can disrupt ETL systems, warehouses, and downstream BI tools, causing incorrect decisions to be made and a loss of trust in the data that is hard to gain back. Imagine software engineering teams lacking a tool like Datadog and only finding out about issues when users complain or simply stop using your application — that is the state of data teams today.
We’re building a platform for high performing data teams (like Bose, Sotheby’s, Ramp, Klaviyo, Sigma, and many more) so they can continuously monitor their data pipelines and know when things break, what went wrong, and how to fix it — all before downstream consumers message them asking “is this dashboard broken?”

- The 401K match is not 100% yours, you'll have to wait 6 years to get 100% of their match. Most big companies do not have that. - Paternity leave is only 2 weeks, and that isn't enough time. It's little time for a father to bond with their child and care for their partner, and in turn, implies that it’s the mother who is to be the primary caregiver. Both parents play a role when welcoming a new born and equalizing the roles of men and women both in the workplace and at home is critical. Also, many companies, including my partner's, are giving 12-16 weeks maternity leave for both parents with flexible options on how to use it. - Paid time off and Health Insurance are good.",4.0,WebstaurantStore,"Lititz, PA",1001 to 5000 Employees,2004,Company - Private,Other Retail Stores,Retail & Wholesale,$500 million to $1 billion (USD)

Employer summary
TriNet is a company committed to offering a benefits package that provides security and well-being to its colleagues and their eligible dependents, including domestic partners.
INSURANCE COVERAGE CHOICES
Coverage choices provide flexibility in the type and cost of colleague benefits. TriNet’s medical, dental and vision insurance programs offer a wide range of benefit options. Depending on the plan you select, TriNet may cover up to 90% of the cost of colleague benefits and up to 75% of the cost toward coverage for dependents. Plan choices include PPO, HDHP and HMO plans from leading medical, dental and vision insurance providers.
SHORT/LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND LIFE AND AD&D COVERAGE
TriNet pays 100% of the cost for short- and longterm disability coverage for full- time colleagues. TriNet also provides company-paid Basic Life and AD&D coverage in the amount of two times your annual base benefits rate (defined as base salary, commission and bonus), with minimum coverage of $100,000 and maximum coverage of $1 million.
401(K) SAVINGS PLAN
TriNet’s 401(k) Savings Plan is administered by Transamerica, and enrollment is automatic at 4% contribution, unless a colleague declines participation or elects a different contribution rate. Through payroll deduction, a colleague may elect to make pre-tax contributions, Roth contributions or a combination of both. TriNet will match a colleague’s contribution up to 4% of cash compensation, and 100% of the employer match vests immediately. PAID TIME OFF (PTO) TriNet allows for flexibility in taking time off. For the first three (3) years of employment, a full-time colleague may earn up to seventeen (17) days of PTO per year. In addition, TriNet offers five (5) days of Paid Sick and Family Care Leave per year.

Employer summary
PayPal wants our employees to feel secure in their benefits, and we support your mental, physical, and emotional balance. Best of all, you are eligible for coverage on your date of hire.

Health and Welfare
Our fulltime U.S.-based employees are eligible for a variety of medical, dental, and vision plans, as well as Short- and Long-Term Disability, Life Insurance, and Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D). Coverage choices for medical coverage will vary, depending on your US location. Dental and vision plan choices are available.

Financial Security
Your financial security is important to us, so we offer a variety of options to choose from, including 401k Savings Plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and Flexible Spending Accounts for health care and dependent care.

Time-Off Programs
PayPal recognizes that as employees pass through various life stages, their time away needs change accordingly. We provide support through the following programs:

Sabbatical Program: 4 weeks of paid leave after completion of 5 years of service
Tracking-Free Vacation: all U.S.-based exempt employees self-manage vacation and work with supervisors to schedule time off.
Give Time: After one year of employment, eligible employees are paid 100% of base pay, or 8 hours/year, to volunteer at a qualifying community-based organization
Paid Sick Leave
Enhanced Maternity Benefit
Paid Bonding Leave within the first year of the birth or placement of a child; available to all mothers, fathers, same-sex spouses, and domestic partners
Paid Family Care Leave allows paid time off for employees to care for a seriously ill family member
Holidays: PayPal observes 10 holidays each year

Additional benefits to support your everyday living include adoption assistance, educational assistance, and employee assistance. We have the added extras too – group legal benefits, identity theft protection, and we even offer pet insurance.

Decent offer package but low pay increases and growth opportunities at the company. Best thing about this place is remote work and flexible schedules. This is the first company that I have worked for that truly respects distributed teams and remote work. There are offices in various cities you can go into if that is your preferred working style but it is entirely optional.

Current Lead Software Engineer in Phoenix, AZ, Arizona
Best thing is the unlimited PTO, work from home flexibility, and company bonuses. Worst thing is the health insurance, just because costs keep going up each year. While LH covers a significant portion of health insurance costs, it's still a painful bump if utilizing family plans. I'm assuming the health insurance premium increases are an across company thing, rather than an isolated element LH can control.

Today, HCLTech (which spun off as a separate unit in 1991) is one of the leading IT service providers worldwide. But while we may be a globally recognized leader in the tech and IT industry, we’ve never forgotten the start-up mindset that got us here.
We’ve always approached our work with an idea-first attitude because every one of our accomplishments—no matter how big or small—can be traced back to an idea’s single spark.
It’s that spark—that inner drive—that sets our people apart from our competitors. It enables us not just to pull off game-changing feat after game-changing feat but to better our world in the process.
At HCLTech, you’ll supercharge your potential.
You’ll find your career.
And you’ll find your spark.
All at a place that knows that helping its customers stay on top starts by putting its people first.
We offer:

Make an Impact
We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

Make an Impact
We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

They did not offer any support on bringing my accommodation requests to fruition and clearly indicated they did not think my requests for *a chronic and underlying condition* were not reasonable.

Spring Health – Why work with us
Life at Spring Health- Breaking Barriers
Spring Values
Spring Careers
Spring Benefits
Today, one in five Americans experience a diagnosable mental illness, yet 82% aren’t getting the care they need. Unfortunately, traditional mental health solutions were not built to acknowledge the unique needs of each person. This results in a poor experience, as patients must test multiple treatment and provider options to find the right fit.
Everyone is different, and one size does not fit all - especially when it comes to mental health. Our approach is designed to treat the individual, leveraging technology to assess conditions and working with best-in-class providers to navigate and deliver care. We treat the whole landscape of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression and addiction, supporting each individual along the way from detection to recovery. 
We set ourselves apart with an unwavering commitment to evidence. Whereas other solutions are ""based on science"", we are built from it. Spring Health is the only corporate mental wellness solution that has been peer-reviewed and clinically validated, leading to faster outcomes than conventional care.

As the fastest growing distributor of foodservice equipment parts, we like to do things a little differently. We believe our team should be like family. Not like a second cousin, twice removed, but more like the family you choose to be with every day. First, you have to demonstrate our core values and keep safety as your #1 priority, that’s key. But we’re also looking for unique enthusiasm, high integrity, courage to embrace change…and if you know a few jokes, that puts you on the top of our list.

Do you have a genius-level knowledge of foodservice equipment parts? If not, no problem! We’re more interested in passionate people with fresh ideas from different backgrounds. That’s what keeps us at the top of our game. We’re proud that our workplace has been recognized for its growth and innovation on the Inc. 5000 list, fifteen years in a row, and the Crain’s Fast 50 list ten times. We are honored to be voted by our Chicagoland team as a Chicago Tribune Top Workplace for three consecutive years in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Parts Town – Why work with us
Careers
Our Culture
Meet Our Team
We’re interested in people with unique enthusiasm who live our core values (Safety, Integrity, Community, Passion, Courage, and Innovation) every day. It’s important to us to find people from different backgrounds who thrive in a fast-paced growth environment and are passionate about expanding our community with new ideas. We look for people who believe in themselves and our mission. We’re not looking for people who settle for second; we want Townspeople who aren’t satisfied with first!
As we search for new Townspeople, we look for the talent and core values fit first, then work experience. We believe long-term success will come from hiring passionate people who believe in our core values versus hiring based solely on work experience.
Caution: Our culture isn't for everyone. If you like quiet, prefer hiding in an office, thrive in an individual (rather than team) environment, love to be in meetings all day, or if you prefer things the way they’ve always been – this is not the place for you! The process of joining Parts Town typically involves a series of interviews with team members and one or more members of the Parts Town leadership team. Additionally, all potential team members must complete a background check and drug screen (varies by state) prior to joining Parts Town. If you thrive in a fast-paced environment, want to make a big impact and have some fun along the way - take the leap and apply today to join our Town!

Health, Dental and Vision benefits are excellent. Long term disability is not as good as it used to be there is no longer a pension plan, Some other benefits have taken a hit in recent years, but probably no different than other similar companies (hence I docked a star for these changes). Work from home 2-3 days a week, which is nice and there is a gym at the office, so that's a benefit.

Senior Data Scientist,-1,"About Metaplane
Metaplane helps companies trust their data.
Before Metaplane, data teams were often the last to find out about data quality issues. Silent data bugs can disrupt ETL systems, warehouses, and downstream BI tools, causing incorrect decisions to be made and a loss of trust in the data that is hard to gain back. Imagine software engineering teams lacking a tool like Datadog and only finding out about issues when users complain or simply stop using your application — that is the state of data teams today.
We’re building a platform for high performing data teams (like Bose, Sotheby’s, Ramp, Klaviyo, Sigma, and many more) so they can continuously monitor their data pipelines and know when things break, what went wrong, and how to fix it — all before downstream consumers message them asking “is this dashboard broken?”

- The 401K match is not 100% yours, you'll have to wait 6 years to get 100% of their match. Most big companies do not have that. - Paternity leave is only 2 weeks, and that isn't enough time. It's little time for a father to bond with their child and care for their partner, and in turn, implies that it’s the mother who is to be the primary caregiver. Both parents play a role when welcoming a new born and equalizing the roles of men and women both in the workplace and at home is critical. Also, many companies, including my partner's, are giving 12-16 weeks maternity leave for both parents with flexible options on how to use it. - Paid time off and Health Insurance are good.",4.0,WebstaurantStore,"Lititz, PA",1001 to 5000 Employees,2004,Company - Private,Other Retail Stores,Retail & Wholesale,$500 million to $1 billion (USD)

Employer summary
TriNet is a company committed to offering a benefits package that provides security and well-being to its colleagues and their eligible dependents, including domestic partners.
INSURANCE COVERAGE CHOICES
Coverage choices provide flexibility in the type and cost of colleague benefits. TriNet’s medical, dental and vision insurance programs offer a wide range of benefit options. Depending on the plan you select, TriNet may cover up to 90% of the cost of colleague benefits and up to 75% of the cost toward coverage for dependents. Plan choices include PPO, HDHP and HMO plans from leading medical, dental and vision insurance providers.
SHORT/LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND LIFE AND AD&D COVERAGE
TriNet pays 100% of the cost for short- and longterm disability coverage for full- time colleagues. TriNet also provides company-paid Basic Life and AD&D coverage in the amount of two times your annual base benefits rate (defined as base salary, commission and bonus), with minimum coverage of $100,000 and maximum coverage of $1 million.
401(K) SAVINGS PLAN
TriNet’s 401(k) Savings Plan is administered by Transamerica, and enrollment is automatic at 4% contribution, unless a colleague declines participation or elects a different contribution rate. Through payroll deduction, a colleague may elect to make pre-tax contributions, Roth contributions or a combination of both. TriNet will match a colleague’s contribution up to 4% of cash compensation, and 100% of the employer match vests immediately. PAID TIME OFF (PTO) TriNet allows for flexibility in taking time off.

Health and Welfare
Our fulltime U.S.-based employees are eligible for a variety of medical, dental, and vision plans, as well as Short- and Long-Term Disability, Life Insurance, and Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D).

Best thing is the unlimited PTO, work from home flexibility, and company bonuses. Worst thing is the health insurance, just because costs keep going up each year. While LH covers a significant portion of health insurance costs, it's still a painful bump if utilizing family plans. I'm assuming the health insurance premium increases are an across company thing, rather than an isolated element LH can control.

Today, HCLTech (which spun off as a separate unit in 1991) is one of the leading IT service providers worldwide. But while we may be a globally recognized leader in the tech and IT industry, we’ve never forgotten the start-up mindset that got us here.

It’s that spark—that inner drive—that sets our people apart from our competitors. It enables us not just to pull off game-changing feat after game-changing feat but to better our world in the process.
At HCLTech, you’ll supercharge your potential.
You’ll find your career.
And you’ll find your spark.
All at a place that knows that helping its customers stay on top starts by putting its people first.
We offer:
career opportunities on your terms

Make an Impact
We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

They did not offer any support on bringing my accommodation requests to fruition and clearly indicated they did not think my requests for *a chronic and underlying condition* were not reasonable.

Spring Benefits
Today, one in five Americans experience a diagnosable mental illness, yet 82% aren’t getting the care they need. Unfortunately, traditional mental health solutions were not built to acknowledge the unique needs of each person. This results in a poor experience, as patients must test multiple treatment and provider options to find the right fit.
Everyone is different, and one size does not fit all - especially when it comes to mental health. Our approach is designed to treat the individual, leveraging technology to assess conditions and working with best-in-class providers to navigate and deliver care. We treat the whole landscape of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression and addiction, supporting each individual along the way from detection to recovery. 
We set ourselves apart with an unwavering commitment to evidence. Whereas other solutions are ""based on science"", we are built from it. Spring Health is the only corporate mental wellness solution that has been peer-reviewed and clinically validated, leading to faster outcomes than conventional care.

As the fastest growing distributor of foodservice equipment parts, we like to do things a little differently. We believe our team should be like family. Not like a second cousin, twice removed, but more like the family you choose to be with every day. First, you have to demonstrate our core values and keep safety as your #1 priority, that’s key. But we’re also looking for unique enthusiasm, high integrity, courage to embrace change…and if you know a few jokes, that puts you on the top of our list.

Do you have a genius-level knowledge of foodservice equipment parts? If not, no problem! We’re more interested in passionate people with fresh ideas from different backgrounds. That’s what keeps us at the top of our game. We’re proud that our workplace has been recognized for its growth and innovation on the Inc. 5000 list, fifteen years in a row, and the Crain’s Fast 50 list ten times. We are honored to be voted by our Chicagoland team as a Chicago Tribune Top Workplace for three consecutive years in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Parts Town – Why work with us
Careers
Our Culture
Meet Our Team
We’re interested in people with unique enthusiasm who live our core values (Safety, Integrity, Community, Passion, Courage, and Innovation) every day. It’s important to us to find people from different backgrounds who thrive in a fast-paced growth environment and are passionate about expanding our community with new ideas. We look for people who believe in themselves and our mission. We’re not looking for people who settle for second; we want Townspeople who aren’t satisfied with first!
As we search for new Townspeople, we look for the talent and core values fit first, then work experience. We believe long-term success will come from hiring passionate people who believe in our core values versus hiring based solely on work experience.
Caution: Our culture isn't for everyone. If you like quiet, prefer hiding in an office, thrive in an individual (rather than team) environment, love to be in meetings all day, or if you prefer things the way they’ve always been – this is not the place for you! The process of joining Parts Town typically involves a series of interviews with team members and one or more members of the Parts Town leadership team. Additionally, all potential team members must complete a background check and drug screen (varies by state) prior to joining Parts Town. If you thrive in a fast-paced environment, want to make a big impact and have some fun along the way - take the leap and apply today to join our Town!

Health, Dental and Vision benefits are excellent. Long term disability is not as good as it used to be there is no longer a pension plan, Some other benefits have taken a hit in recent years, but probably no different than other similar companies (hence I docked a star for these changes). Work from home 2-3 days a week, which is nice and there is a gym at the office, so that's a benefit.

Senior Data Scientist,-1,"About Metaplane
Metaplane helps companies trust their data.
Before Metaplane, data teams were often the last to find out about data quality issues. Silent data bugs can disrupt ETL systems, warehouses, and downstream BI tools, causing incorrect decisions to be made and a loss of trust in the data that is hard to gain back. Imagine software engineering teams lacking a tool like Datadog and only finding out about issues when users complain or simply stop using your application — that is the state of data teams today.
We’re building a platform for high performing data teams (like Bose, Sotheby’s, Ramp, Klaviyo, Sigma, and many more) so they can continuously monitor their data pipelines and know when things break, what went wrong, and how to fix it — all before downstream consumers message them asking “is this dashboard broken?”

- The 401K match is not 100% yours, you'll have to wait 6 years to get 100% of their match. Most big companies do not have that. - Paternity leave is only 2 weeks, and that isn't enough time. It's little time for a father to bond with their child and care for their partner, and in turn, implies that it’s the mother who is to be the primary caregiver. Both parents play a role when welcoming a new born and equalizing the roles of men and women both in the workplace and at home is critical. Also, many companies, including my partner's, are giving 12-16 weeks maternity leave for both parents with flexible options on how to use it. - Paid time off and Health Insurance are good.",4.0,WebstaurantStore,"Lititz, PA",1001 to 5000 Employees,2004,Company - Private,Other Retail Stores,Retail & Wholesale,$500 million to $1 billion (USD)

Employer summary
TriNet is a company committed to offering a benefits package that provides security and well-being to its colleagues and their eligible dependents, including domestic partners.
INSURANCE COVERAGE CHOICES
Coverage choices provide flexibility in the type and cost of colleague benefits. TriNet’s medical, dental and vision insurance programs offer a wide range of benefit options. Depending on the plan you select, TriNet may cover up to 90% of the cost of colleague benefits and up to 75% of the cost toward coverage for dependents. Plan choices include PPO, HDHP and HMO plans from leading medical, dental and vision insurance providers.
SHORT/LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND LIFE AND AD&D COVERAGE
TriNet pays 100% of the cost for short- and longterm disability coverage for full- time colleagues. TriNet also provides company-paid Basic Life and AD&D coverage in the amount of two times your annual base benefits rate (defined as base salary, commission and bonus), with minimum coverage of $100,000 and maximum coverage of $1 million.
401(K) SAVINGS PLAN
TriNet’s 401(k) Savings Plan is administered by Transamerica, and enrollment is automatic at 4% contribution, unless a colleague declines participation or elects a different contribution rate. Through payroll deduction, a colleague may elect to make pre-tax contributions, Roth contributions or a combination of both. TriNet will match a colleague’s contribution up to 4% of cash compensation, and 100% of the employer match vests immediately. PAID TIME OFF (PTO) TriNet allows for flexibility in taking time off. For the first three (3) years of employment, a full-time colleague may earn up to seventeen (17) days of PTO per year. In addition, TriNet offers five (5) days of Paid Sick and Family Care Leave per year.

Best thing is the unlimited PTO, work from home flexibility, and company bonuses. Worst thing is the health insurance, just because costs keep going up each year. While LH covers a significant portion of health insurance costs, it's still a painful bump if utilizing family plans. I'm assuming the health insurance premium increases are an across company thing, rather than an isolated element LH can control.

Today, HCLTech (which spun off as a separate unit in 1991) is one of the leading IT service providers worldwide. But while we may be a globally recognized leader in the tech and IT industry, we’ve never forgotten the start-up mindset that got us here.

It’s that spark—that inner drive—that sets our people apart from our competitors. It enables us not just to pull off game-changing feat after game-changing feat but to better our world in the process.
At HCLTech, you’ll supercharge your potential.
You’ll find your career.
And you’ll find your spark.
All at a place that knows that helping its customers stay on top starts by putting its people first.

Make an Impact
We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

Life at Spring Health- Breaking Barriers

Spring Benefits
Today, one in five Americans experience a diagnosable mental illness, yet 82% aren’t getting the care they need. Unfortunately, traditional mental health solutions were not built to acknowledge the unique needs of each person. This results in a poor experience, as patients must test multiple treatment and provider options to find the right fit.
Everyone is different, and one size does not fit all - especially when it comes to mental health. Our approach is designed to treat the individual, leveraging technology to assess conditions and working with best-in-class providers to navigate and deliver care. We treat the whole landscape of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression and addiction, supporting each individual along the way from detection to recovery. 
We set ourselves apart with an unwavering commitment to evidence. Whereas other solutions are ""based on science"", we are built from it. Spring Health is the only corporate mental wellness solution that has been peer-reviewed and clinically validated, leading to faster outcomes than conventional care.

As the fastest growing distributor of foodservice equipment parts, we like to do things a little differently. We believe our team should be like family. Not like a second cousin, twice removed, but more like the family you choose to be with every day. First, you have to demonstrate our core values and keep safety as your #1 priority, that’s key. But we’re also looking for unique enthusiasm, high integrity, courage to embrace change…and if you know a few jokes, that puts you on the top of our list.

Do you have a genius-level knowledge of foodservice equipment parts? If not, no problem! We’re more interested in passionate people with fresh ideas from different backgrounds. That’s what keeps us at the top of our game. We’re proud that our workplace has been recognized for its growth and innovation on the Inc. 5000 list, fifteen years in a row, and the Crain’s Fast 50 list ten times. We are honored to be voted by our Chicagoland team as a Chicago Tribune Top Workplace for three consecutive years in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Careers
Our Culture
Meet Our Team
We’re interested in people with unique enthusiasm who live our core values (Safety, Integrity, Community, Passion, Courage, and Innovation) every day. It’s important to us to find people from different backgrounds who thrive in a fast-paced growth environment and are passionate about expanding our community with new ideas. We look for people who believe in themselves and our mission. We’re not looking for people who settle for second; we want Townspeople who aren’t satisfied with first!
As we search for new Townspeople, we look for the talent and core values fit first, then work experience. We believe long-term success will come from hiring passionate people who believe in our core values versus hiring based solely on work experience.
Caution: Our culture isn't for everyone. If you like quiet, prefer hiding in an office, thrive in an individual (rather than team) environment, love to be in meetings all day, or if you prefer things the way they’ve always been – this is not the place for you! The process of joining Parts Town typically involves a series of interviews with team members and one or more members of the Parts Town leadership team. Additionally, all potential team members must complete a background check and drug screen (varies by state) prior to joining Parts Town. If you thrive in a fast-paced environment, want to make a big impact and have some fun along the way - take the leap and apply today to join our Town!

Health, Dental and Vision benefits are excellent. Long term disability is not as good as it used to be there is no longer a pension plan, Some other benefits have taken a hit in recent years, but probably no different than other similar companies (hence I docked a star for these changes). Work from home 2-3 days a week, which is nice and there is a gym at the office, so that's a benefit.

Senior Data Scientist,-1,"About Metaplane
Metaplane helps companies trust their data.
Before Metaplane, data teams were often the last to find out about data quality issues. Silent data bugs can disrupt ETL systems, warehouses, and downstream BI tools, causing incorrect decisions to be made and a loss of trust in the data that is hard to gain back. Imagine software engineering teams lacking a tool like Datadog and only finding out about issues when users complain or simply stop using your application — that is the state of data teams today.
We’re building a platform for high performing data teams (like Bose, Sotheby’s, Ramp, Klaviyo, Sigma, and many more) so they can continuously monitor their data pipelines and know when things break, what went wrong, and how to fix it — all before downstream consumers message them asking “is this dashboard broken?”

- The 401K match is not 100% yours, you'll have to wait 6 years to get 100% of their match. Most big companies do not have that. - Paternity leave is only 2 weeks, and that isn't enough time. It's little time for a father to bond with their child and care for their partner, and in turn, implies that it’s the mother who is to be the primary caregiver. Both parents play a role when welcoming a new born and equalizing the roles of men and women both in the workplace and at home is critical. Also, many companies, including my partner's, are giving 12-16 weeks maternity leave for both parents with flexible options on how to use it. - Paid time off and Health Insurance are good.",4.0,WebstaurantStore,"Lititz, PA",1001 to 5000 Employees,2004,Company - Private,Other Retail Stores,Retail & Wholesale,$500 million to $1 billion (USD)

Employer summary
TriNet is a company committed to offering a benefits package that provides security and well-being to its colleagues and their eligible dependents, including domestic partners.
INSURANCE COVERAGE CHOICES
Coverage choices provide flexibility in the type and cost of colleague benefits. TriNet’s medical, dental and vision insurance programs offer a wide range of benefit options. Depending on the plan you select, TriNet may cover up to 90% of the cost of colleague benefits and up to 75% of the cost toward coverage for dependents. Plan choices include PPO, HDHP and HMO plans from leading medical, dental and vision insurance providers.
SHORT/LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND LIFE AND AD&D COVERAGE
TriNet pays 100% of the cost for short- and longterm disability coverage for full- time colleagues. TriNet also provides company-paid Basic Life and AD&D coverage in the amount of two times your annual base benefits rate (defined as base salary, commission and bonus), with minimum coverage of $100,000 and maximum coverage of $1 million.
401(K) SAVINGS PLAN
TriNet’s 401(k) Savings Plan is administered by Transamerica, and enrollment is automatic at 4% contribution, unless a colleague declines participation or elects a different contribution rate. Through payroll deduction, a colleague may elect to make pre-tax contributions, Roth contributions or a combination of both. TriNet will match a colleague’s contribution up to 4% of cash compensation, and 100% of the employer match vests immediately. PAID TIME OFF (PTO) TriNet allows for flexibility in taking time off. For the first three (3) years of employment, a full-time colleague may earn up to seventeen (17) days of PTO per year. In addition, TriNet offers five (5) days of Paid Sick and Family Care Leave per year.

Employer summary
PayPal wants our employees to feel secure in their benefits, and we support your mental, physical, and emotional balance. Best of all, you are eligible for coverage on your date of hire.

Health and Welfare
Our fulltime U.S.-based employees are eligible for a variety of medical, dental, and vision plans, as well as Short- and Long-Term Disability, Life Insurance, and Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D). Coverage choices for medical coverage will vary, depending on your US location. Dental and vision plan choices are available.

Your financial security is important to us, so we offer a variety of options to choose from, including 401k Savings Plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and Flexible Spending Accounts for health care and dependent care.

Sabbatical Program: 4 weeks of paid leave after completion of 5 years of service
Tracking-Free Vacation: all U.S.-based exempt employees self-manage vacation and work with supervisors to schedule time off.
Give Time: After one year of employment, eligible employees are paid 100% of base pay, or 8 hours/year, to volunteer at a qualifying community-based organization
Paid Sick Leave
Enhanced Maternity Benefit
Paid Bonding Leave within the first year of the birth or placement of a child; available to all mothers, fathers, same-sex spouses, and domestic partners
Paid Family Care Leave allows paid time off for employees to care for a seriously ill family member
Holidays: PayPal observes 10 holidays each year

Additional benefits to support your everyday living include adoption assistance, educational assistance, and employee assistance. We have the added extras too – group legal benefits, identity theft protection, and we even offer pet insurance.

Best thing is the unlimited PTO, work from home flexibility, and company bonuses. Worst thing is the health insurance, just because costs keep going up each year. While LH covers a significant portion of health insurance costs, it's still a painful bump if utilizing family plans. I'm assuming the health insurance premium increases are an across company thing, rather than an isolated element LH can control.

Make an Impact
We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

We're the original challenger FI
At Alliant, we're savvy, selfless and socially responsible. From the moment we started in 1935 as United Airlines Employees’ Credit Union to our current role as a full-service digital financial institution, we've always had to find new and innovative ways to offer our members great rates, low fees and an intuitive banking experience they could count on – regardless of where in the country they are.
So, what makes us different from other financial institutions (FIs)? We've always:
Served our members remotely.
Challenged the industry by offering better-than-bank rates and not gouging members with sneaky fees.
Operated a cashless and low-cost model to allow us to give more back to our members.
We are financially savvy people working for financially savvy people. We'll never stop going all in and all out for members' success because we're owned by our members, not shareholders.
Challenging the banking status quo is in our DNA, and we'll never stop disrupting it – for the good of our members.

The health benefits at MIT are fantastic, however the Disability services at MIT are not. When I approached Disability Services about accommodations with a doctor’s note and they were insensitive, inelegant and unprofessional in their dealings with me. They did not offer any support on bringing my accommodation requests to fruition and clearly indicated they did not think my requests for *a chronic and underlying condition* were not reasonable. They did not offer any advice on how to make the accommodations reasonable. I was shocked by their treatment of me until I realized their primary function was not to help the employees, but to protect MIT.",4.4,MIT,"Cambridge, MA",10000+ Employees,1861,College / University,Colleges & Universities,Education,$1 to $5 billion (USD)

Mentorship & Career Growth

Life at Spring Health- Breaking Barriers

Spring Benefits
Today, one in five Americans experience a diagnosable mental illness, yet 82% aren’t getting the care they need. Unfortunately, traditional mental health solutions were not built to acknowledge the unique needs of each person. This results in a poor experience, as patients must test multiple treatment and provider options to find the right fit.
Everyone is different, and one size does not fit all - especially when it comes to mental health. Our approach is designed to treat the individual, leveraging technology to assess conditions and working with best-in-class providers to navigate and deliver care. We treat the whole landscape of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression and addiction, supporting each individual along the way from detection to recovery. 
We set ourselves apart with an unwavering commitment to evidence. Whereas other solutions are ""based on science"", we are built from it. Spring Health is the only corporate mental wellness solution that has been peer-reviewed and clinically validated, leading to faster outcomes than conventional care.

As the fastest growing distributor of foodservice equipment parts, we like to do things a little differently. We believe our team should be like family. Not like a second cousin, twice removed, but more like the family you choose to be with every day. First, you have to demonstrate our core values and keep safety as your #1 priority, that’s key. But we’re also looking for unique enthusiasm, high integrity, courage to embrace change…and if you know a few jokes, that puts you on the top of our list.

Do you have a genius-level knowledge of foodservice equipment parts? If not, no problem! We’re more interested in passionate people with fresh ideas from different backgrounds. That’s what keeps us at the top of our game. We’re proud that our workplace has been recognized for its growth and innovation on the Inc. 5000 list, fifteen years in a row, and the Crain’s Fast 50 list ten times. We are honored to be voted by our Chicagoland team as a Chicago Tribune Top Workplace for three consecutive years in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Parts Town – Why work with us
Careers
Our Culture
Meet Our Team
We’re interested in people with unique enthusiasm who live our core values (Safety, Integrity, Community, Passion, Courage, and Innovation) every day. It’s important to us to find people from different backgrounds who thrive in a fast-paced growth environment and are passionate about expanding our community with new ideas. We look for people who believe in themselves and our mission. We’re not looking for people who settle for second; we want Townspeople who aren’t satisfied with first!
As we search for new Townspeople, we look for the talent and core values fit first, then work experience. We believe long-term success will come from hiring passionate people who believe in our core values versus hiring based solely on work experience.
Caution: Our culture isn't for everyone. If you like quiet, prefer hiding in an office, thrive in an individual (rather than team) environment, love to be in meetings all day, or if you prefer things the way they’ve always been – this is not the place for you! The process of joining Parts Town typically involves a series of interviews with team members and one or more members of the Parts Town leadership team. Additionally, all potential team members must complete a background check and drug screen (varies by state) prior to joining Parts Town. If you thrive in a fast-paced environment, want to make a big impact and have some fun along the way - take the leap and apply today to join our Town!
